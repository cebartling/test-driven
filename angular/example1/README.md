# Angular TDD example 1

## Introduction

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0. [Angular CLI documentation](https://angular.io/cli)
- This project is managed by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and has a `.nvmrc` file in the root directory. It is currently configured for Node.js version `lts/fermium`.
  - When you execute `nvm use`, you should see something similar like this: 
    ```shell
    Found '/Users/chris/github-sandbox/cebartling/test-driven/angular/example1/.nvmrc' with version <lts/fermium>
    Now using node v14.17.4 (npm v6.14.14)
    ```
  - There is a Windows version of `nvm`, found [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
