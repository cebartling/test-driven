## SOLID principles
- SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 
- The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin (_aka_ Uncle Bob), first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
- Single-responsibility principle
- Open–closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
- In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

---


## Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

---


## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- Design by contract.

---


## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

---


## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

---

## Resources

- Clean Code. Robert C. Martin.
