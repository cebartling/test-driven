## Introduction to Test-Driven Development
### Christopher Bartling

## Why Test-Driven Development
- Code design
	- Tests communicate soundness of design decisions
- Executable documentation
	- Communicates intent

## Test-driven development mantra

- Red: Write a test that doesn't work or perhaps doesn't even compile
- Green: Make the test pass--don't worry about code duplication at this point
- Refactor: Eliminate code duplication and make source code more communicative, all the while making sure all tests continue to pass successfully
