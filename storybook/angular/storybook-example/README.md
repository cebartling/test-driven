# Storybook and Angular Example

- [StoryBook Angular tutorial](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/angular/en/get-started/)


## Storybook server

- Run `ng run storybook` to start the Storybook server and open a browser to the Storybook web site locally. 


## Running unit tests

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `ng run test:coverage` to execute the unit tests with code coverage.


## Development server

1. Run `ng run json-server` to run the JSON API server. More information on the json-server [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
1. Run `ng serve` to run the Webpack dev server. 
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
