# Testcontainers Java Demo

This Java project demonstrates the use of [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to facilitate integration testing.
Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit 4/5 and Spock tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

This example is pretty simple; a single PostgreSQL database is the only external dependency that is managed by Testcontainers within JUnit 5 integration tests.
